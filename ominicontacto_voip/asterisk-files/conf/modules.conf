;
; Any modules that need to be loaded before the Asterisk core has been
; initialized (just after the logger has been initialized) can be loaded
; using 'preload'. This will frequently be needed if you wish to map all
; module configuration files into Realtime storage, since the Realtime
; driver will need to be loaded before the modules using those configuration
; files are initialized.
;
; An example of loading ODBC support would be:
preload => res_odbc.so
;preload => res_config_odbc.so
;
; Uncomment the following if you wish to use the Speech Recognition API
;preload => res_speech.so
;
; If you want Asterisk to fail if a module does not load, then use
; the "require" keyword. Asterisk will exit with a status code of 2
; if a required module does not load.
;
; require = chan_sip.so
; If you want you can combine with preload
; preload-require = res_odbc.so
;
; If you want, load the GTK console right away.
